HRview is a specialized software tool that allows for thorough analysis of results obtained from Fourier transform alternating current voltammetry (FTaCV) experiments. HRview is able to read the measurement file directly and automatically displays the power spectrum, DC, and harmonics without the need for any prior data manipulation. Additionally, HRview provides a suite for a simulation software called MECSim, which can be run and displayed through the HRview interface.

The most updated version can be found in the releases: https://github.com/friedmanariel/HRview/releases

It is recommended to install HRview in the default folder (...AppData\Local\) or a similar folder which does not require an administrator privileges.

MECsim can be downloaded from Gareth Kennedy's page on GitHub: https://github.com/garethkennedy/MECSim_Analytics/blob/master/MECSim.exe
