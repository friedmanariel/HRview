HRview is a specialized software tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of results from Fourier Transform Alternating Current Voltammetry (FTaCV) experiments. It simplifies data handling by directly reading measurement files and automatically displaying the power spectrum, DC, and harmonicsâ€”eliminating the need for prior data manipulation.

HRview also includes a seamless integration with MECSim, a powerful simulation suite that can be run and visualized directly within the HRview interface.

The most recent version of HRview is available here: https://github.com/friedmanariel/HRview/releases

For optimal performance, we recommend installing HRview in the default directory (...AppData\Local\) or a similar location that does not require administrator privileges.

If you use HRview in published research, please ensure appropriate acknowledgment by citing the following paper- "A Simplified FTacV Model for Evaluating the Electrochemically Active Site Density in PGM-free ORR Catalysts", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142865
